    "#### Implementation (how it works)\n",
    "The for loop runs for 5 times and therefore asks the user for 5 samples. The highest level of pollution is then calculated by comparing each user input by the following user input (each water sample) and then if the new water sample has a higher value than the existing one, the new water sample becomes the highest level of pollution until 5 loops are complete or another water sample exceeds its current value. The average is calculated through another method and the water quality is checked through if conditions to determine if the quality is good, sufficient or poor.Lastly, all the necessary outputs are printed using print statements (average pollution, highest level of pollution and water quality) .\n",
