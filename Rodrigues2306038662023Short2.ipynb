    "goals scored per match and the number of minutes per goal (assuming each match is 90 minutes long).\n",
    "\n",
    "The program MUST be structured as a series of methods where the first method calls a series of others in turn. They will either get values and return results back to the first method, or take arguments and return calculated results or take arguments and print results. \n",
